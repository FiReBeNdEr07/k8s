NAME: external-dns-1590564095
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed May 27 12:51:42 2020
NAMESPACE: default

REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
This Helm chart is deprecated

Given the `stable` deprecation timeline (https://github.com/helm/charts#deprecation-timeline), the Bitnami maintained Helm chart is now located at bitnami/charts (https://github.com/bitnami/charts/).

The Bitnami repository is already included in the Hubs and we will continue providing the same cadence of updates, support, etc that we've been keeping here these years. Installation instructions are very similar, just adding the _bitnami_ repo and using it during the installation (`bitnami/<chart>` instead of `stable/<chart>`)

```bash
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/<chart>           # Helm 3
$ helm install --name my-release bitnami/<chart>    # Helm 2
```

To update an exisiting _stable_ deployment with a chart hosted in the bitnami repository you can execute

```bash
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/<chart>
```

Issues and PRs related to the chart itself will be redirected to `bitnami/charts` GitHub repository. In the same way, we'll be happy to answer questions related to this migration process in this issue (https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/20969) created as a common place for discussion.

** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **

To verify that external-dns has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace=default get pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=external-dns,app.kubernetes.io/instance=external-dns-1590564095"
